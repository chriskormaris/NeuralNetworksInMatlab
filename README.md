# NeuralNetworksInMatlab

Made by Chris Kormaris

Implementation of various Neural Networks. Written in Matlab.

## MNIST Neural Network implementation (Using either Gradient Ascent or Gradient Descent)

Unzip the MNIST data from the compressed file "mnisttxt.zip" in the same directory.
Then, run the Neural Network that uses batch gradient ascent, from the file "demo_mnistNN.m", inside the folder "code", as follows:
```matlab
demo_mnistNN
```

## MNIST Spam Ham implementation

Change directory inside the folder "NN_spam_ham/code".
Then, run the Neural Network "demo_spam_ham_NN.m", as follows:
```matlab
demo_spam_ham_NN
```
